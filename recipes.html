            <div class="text_box">
                <p>Picking a delicious recipe is key to success in the kitchen. Throughout my years of cooking and baking, I've found reputable websites and chefs with fullproof recipes. Some of my favorite recipe sources are below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>My Grandma (she makes the BEST pies and rolls)</li>
                    <li>Cooking Shows on Netflix</li>
                    <li>YouTube Videos</li>
                    <li>Cookbooks</li>
                    <li>Websites, Blogs, and Journals</li>

                <h2>COOKING SHOWS</h2>
                <p>I LOVE cooking shows... in my opinion, there's no better pasttime. My favorite cooking shows on Netflix are the Great British Baking Show (Bakeoff), Korean Class Wars, and Chef's Table. Bakeoff is definitly my favorite because the bakers are supportive, talented, and kind, the judges are entertaining, and I love everyone's British accent. I've rewatched every season multiple times and I love recreating the technical bakes. Korean Class Wars and Chef's Table have a slightly different vibe as both include some of the best chefs from around the world. So, I'm able to learn about modern cooking techniques, visionary flavor pairings, and plating approaches that can't be taught by amateurs. Honestly, I've spent way too much time watching cooking shows, but I've learned so much and there's no better activity than baking with Bakeoff in the background.</p>

                <h2>YOUTUBE VIDEOS</h2>
                <p>In 2020, when I waas first learning to cook, YouTube videos taught me so much! Honestly, I've learned more from cooking YouTube videos than cookbooks, websites, cooking shows, and articles combined. Some of my favorite channels include Claire Saffitz, NYT Cooking, epicurious, ChefSteps, Doobydobap, and Joshua Weissman. Joshua Weissman is probably my favorite YouTube channel because Weissman has a background in fine dining so he's super knowledgable and entertaining. Though some of his jokes miss their mark and his thumbails can be a little bit extra, he's knowledgable is invaluable. His recipes are extremely envolved since almost every element is made by hand including mayo, pickles, spice blends, bread, and more; but, out of the many recipes I've tried, none have failed me. The video to the left is his recipe for Siu Yuk and though I haven't tried it yet, I hope to make my own crispy pork belly soon!</p>

                <h2>COOKBOOKS</h2>
                <p>I've aquired quite the cookbook collection since I started on my culinary adventure. During my early stages of cooking I wasn't a huge fan of cookbooks because I felt like I could find recipes faster and more easily just by looking online. But, over time I've come to develop a greater appreciation for cookbooks. I love he physical aspect of turning pages and not having to worry about my computer screen turning off if I'm following a recipe. Some of my favorite cookbooks include <i>The Apprentice</i> by Jaques Pepin, the collection of Modern Asian cooking and baking books by Lieu, my collection of Bake Off books, <i>Dessert of the Day</i> by Kim Laidlaw, <i>Simple</i> by Ottolenghi, and a Disney Theme Park cookbook. But one of my most prized possessions is the <i>Modernist Cuisine</i> cookbook by the renowned food photographer Nathan Myhrvold. Modernist Cuisine is a project that explores the art and science of cooking and baking. The Modernist Cuisine photos are out of this world and done completely practical (I highly recommend you look up a Modernist Cuisine Gallery... you will be blown away). Additionally, the food science is so indepth and thorough there's so much knowledge to be aquired from these books. The Modernist Cuisine catalog includes 17 books on bread, food & drink, pizza, photophraphy, a Modernist Cuisine at home book, and the original collection. I currently own <i>Modernist Cuisine At Home</i> and I aspire to own the original Modernist Cuisine collection that unfortunately costs $625.000. Picture to the right are the five books in the original collection.</p>

                <h2>WEBSITES</h2>
                <p>Cooking websites, blogs, and journals are fundamental to everyone's culinary journey. They're accessible, diverse, and simple. Nowadays, you can find any recipe on the Internet. Some of my favorite websites include: <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking, <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/">bon appetit</a>, and <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/">epicurious</a>. But, NYT Cooking is my favorite... I'm not saying that I'm a bad student, but sometimes when I'm bored in class and the lecture isn't particularly interesting, I'l browse on NYT Cooking to see if I can find my next recipe. And, it's very easy to find inspiration because there's all kinds of cuisines, meals, ingredients, and recipes by many different chefs. All NYT recipes have clear instructions and might even include a video so they're super easy to follow. I recommend NYT Cooking to everyone whether you're a novice cook or celebrated chef since there's a recipe for everyone. </p>
